   abstract: "In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Agenda 2030, which comprises 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG7 — 'Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030' — forms the focus of this work. Roughly 15% of the world’s population (1.1 billion people) lack access to electricity, with 87% of those residing in rural areas. This paper presents a GIS-based approach coupled with open-access data to identify least-cost electrification strategies across Sub-Saharan Africa. Options include grid extension, mini-grid, and standalone systems. The study finds standalone technologies most suitable for low-demand areas, while higher-demand contexts shift towards mini-grid and grid-extension solutions."

   abstract: "Achieving universal electricity access remains a key development challenge. The increasing availability of open-access geospatial data has greatly enhanced planning capabilities and progress tracking for SDG7. This paper introduces and tests the 2018 version of the Open Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit (OnSSET) using Malawi as a case study. Results show that off-grid PV is the least-cost option for 67.4% of Malawians at a total cost of $1.83 billion, while grid extension can connect 32.6% of the population by 2030. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that projected electricity demand strongly influences both least-cost technology mix and required investment, with total costs ranging between $1.65–7.78 billion."

   abstract: "This paper presents the first application of a scenario discovery approach within geospatial electrification modelling. A total of 1,944 electrification simulations were constructed for Burkina Faso using combinations of seven input parameters, including four grid-extension strategies. The analysis identifies scenarios where high grid-generation costs combined with intensification strategies lead to higher electricity costs. The study highlights key cost drivers — such as grid generation costs and discount rates — and demonstrates how scenario discovery offers a structured method to analyze multi-dimensional uncertainties, reducing bias and enhancing the robustness of electrification planning insights."
